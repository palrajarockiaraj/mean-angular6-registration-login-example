# Running the MEAN with Angular 6 User Registration & Login Example Locally

IMPORTANT: To run MEAN stack applications locally you need NodeJS installed and MongoDB running.

The project contains two applications, one for the client and another for the server api, below are the steps to get each of them setup and running:

## Running the MEAN Stack Server API
 1. Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running
 
 2. Open a command line window and navigate to the "/server" folder below the project root folder
 
 3. Run `npm install` to install all required npm packages that are defined in the package.json file
 
 4. Run `node server.js` to start the server, by default it runs at http://localhost:4000

## Running the Angular 6 Client
 1. Open a command line window and navigate to the "/client" folder below the project root folder
 
 2. Run `npm install` to install all required npm packages that are defined in the package.json file
 
 3. Run `ng serve -o` to start the client, a browser window should automatically open to the application at http://localhost:4200
